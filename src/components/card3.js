            <p className="p1">Nestled in the city of Roorkee, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee stands tall as a beacon of excellence in higher education and research. Established in 1847 as the Thomason College of Civil Engineering, it has since evolved into one of India's premier engineering institutions. IIT Roorkee boasts a rich history and a vibrant campus, where academic brilliance thrives in harmony with a multitude of extracurricular activities. </p>
            <p className="p1">Being in the field of civil engineering hasn't limited my exploration of other domains. The supportive environment at my college has provided me with opportunities to delve into diverse areas such as web development, coding, and robotics. Despite my academic focus on civil engineering, I have embraced the chance to learn and grow in these additional disciplines. Through the encouragement and resources available, I have been able to develop skills in web development, coding languages, and even robotics. This interdisciplinary approach has enriched my educational experience, allowing me to broaden my horizons and gain a more comprehensive understanding of technology and its applications.</p>
